# Withfur

<!-- Insert render here -->

This is my personal avatar, [available on mod.io] so that it can be downloaded
automatically by [Fusion].

## What is this thing?

It's a protogen! Modified from [fribsey's Withfur VRChat avatar].

## What does it do?

It does its best.

## No but really

Well... it has pretty terrible stats... but if there was a goober stat it would
be off the charts.

(There is now also a human-sized avatar variant, which is still a bit weaker
than most humans but is much closer.)
